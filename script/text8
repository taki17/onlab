In the first encounter between the duke of York Colin Firth known by family members as Bertie and the unorthodox Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue Geoffrey Rush we see how Logue who is impervious to royalty begins to break down the barriers of class and position that have walled in the future King George VI who has an acute stammer The two men have been brought together through the persistence of the dukes wife the Duchess of York Helena Bonham Carter after conventional doctors have failed to help him

Int Logues consultation room  day

A different universe from the spartan waiting area A world of books piles of them spilling everywhere Two slightly shabby but comfortable armchairs Wellworn Turkish rug

Hot plate and two chipped mugs Recording apparatus Model airplanes

Bertie sits uneasily on an armchair Lionel goes to sit at a distance

LIONEL I was told not to sit too close

Bertie remains silent

I was also told speaking with a royal one waits for the royal to choose the topic

BERTIE Waiting for me to commence a conversation one can wait a rather long wait

LIONEL Know any jokes

BERTIE Timing is not my strong suit

Silence They stare at each other

LIONEL Cuppa tea

BERTIE No thank you

LIONEL I think I will have one

Turns on the hot plate

BERTIE Arent you going to start treating me Dr Logue

LIONEL Only if you are interested in being treated Please call me Lionel

BERTIE I prefer Doctor

LIONEL I prefer Lionel What will I call you

BERTIE Your Royal Highness then Sir after that

LIONEL A bit formal for here What about your name

BERTIE Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George

LIONEL How about Bertie

BERTIE flushes Only my family uses that
